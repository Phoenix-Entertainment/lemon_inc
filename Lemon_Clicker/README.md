# Lemon Clicker Repo
Here you will find the code for Lemon Clicker, a Cookie Clicker inspired game written in Python 3.8.1 with Pygame. <br>

## TODO:
* Add in upgrades like auto clickers and reduced cooldown time for clicks
* Remove the ability for the user to hold down the mouse button over the lemon so it clicks immediately after the cooldown period is over
* Make a better background
* Jumble up the save_data.lemon file so modifying the score is difficult, this could be dome by simply placing the score in the middle of a bunch of garbage and only reading a specific part of the file.
